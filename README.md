# How To Use Budget Rewired
  
There are three main views in the application: **Vote**, **Report** and **Global**. Those views show the budget of 2012/2013.  
The application works across multiple devices and updates in realtime (the server is slow so, it's a bit un-realtime, might fail to load a few times).  
  
We're assuming you have access to multiple devices, if that isn't the case, just open all links in different tabs ;)  
  
## Lets start!

1. Open the [Global view](http://budgetrewired.rs.af.cm/view/global) on your main browser  
This is where the current average of all votes is shown and updates in realtime.  
Should look like this:

2. Open the [Vote view](http://budgetrewired.rs.af.cm/) on your mobile or second screen  
You can vote here and this will affect the global view.  
**The left column** represents inputs. This is where you decide how you'd get all the money that goes into the budget.  
**The right column** represents the spending. This is where you decide how you'd spend the money.

3. Use the arrows and try setting _Borrowing_, in the left column, down to 5%.  
**Remember** all values have to add up to 100% and the system won't let you insert invalid values!  
  
4. Press the **Submit** button.  
You'll be redirected to the report view where you can compare your vote with the real, government approved, budget and all the other voters.

You can also share your submission with other people, simply share the report url.  

***

You'll notice that the bars, in the [Global view](http://budgetrewired.rs.af.cm/view/global) will start moving automatically as you, or other people, vote.  
  
**I hope you have fun using it**
